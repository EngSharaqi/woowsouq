## Woowsouq is an e-commerce website, android / ios application to help people making online shopping, specially Libyans ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¾ customers.
#### The problem / Solution was making a clear responsive design that suitable with Libyans style, clear, simple and usable, So I decided to work on the project for Mobile, Tablet and Laptop views with flat style and hot colors for action needs and cold colors for long-time view like texts and clean view with white-spaces.
#### Created using: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4 & MediaQuery
